In an increasingly data-driven world, the use of mathematics in modern society pivots on the evaluation of computationally-intractable problems.  These problems may rely on algorithms being implemented hundreds of times, or could involve the inversion of matrices with dimensions in the thousands.  Such tasks cannot possibly be completed on a simple calculator, and so any modern mathematician must be equipped with an understanding of computer programming.
